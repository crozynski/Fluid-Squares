Fluid-Squares
=============

A fluid grid of square units.

Fluid Squares preserves a unit's square proportion within a fluid layout. Number of columns also reduce to suit browser or device width using CSS media queries.

The original version used a transparent image with max-width:100%. Marco Lago stepped up with a clever CSS method that eliminates the need for images. This new version also uses css3-mediaqueries.js (now works in IE) and is Mobile First.
